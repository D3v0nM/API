# API

Running the swagger page locally on your machine:

1. Download the swagger-ui-dist folder to your computer. It contains a copy of the MerryFairyTalesAPI.yaml file.
2. Click on the index.html file in that folder, and it will run our API documentation in the Swagger UI. 
NOTE: It doesn't work in Chrome when running locally, but you can use Firefox, Edge, or another browser.

Alternatively, you can view the yaml file in the Swagger editor: https://editor.swagger.io/
